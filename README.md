## Description

This project is a clone of the Google.com search engine, designed to provide a seamless user experience across various devices. The web page is **fully responsive**, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction on both desktop and mobile platforms.

Additionally, I have implemented a **dark mode** feature, allowing users to switch to a visually-friendly dark theme, which not only reduces eye strain but also enhances the overall browsing experience.

Moreover, this Google.com clone supports **landscape mode** on mobile devices, optimizing the layout for wider screens. This ensures that users get a consistent and user-friendly experience regardless of their device's orientation.

The project's responsive design, dark mode, and landscape mode capabilities make it a versatile and user-centric alternative to the original Google search page.

- Basic search functionality
- Display of search results
